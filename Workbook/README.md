# WorkBook

Navigate in each exercise folder to understand what you should do.

**Note that**: you could need some python libraries inside the [utils folder](https://github.com/edoardottt/programming-fundamentals/tree/master/utils) to run programs or tests. Be sure to copy those files inside the exercise folder.
